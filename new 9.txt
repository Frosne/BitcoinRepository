One of the most important tasks during the execution was testing and future analysis. 
The achieved results, that will be described in this chapter will be also devided into 3 parts, as it was described in previous chapter. \\ \\
The first part was creating a transaction. The algorithms for the transaction creation were successfully implemented. \\
Because we wanted to achieve the really working wallet that will generate real transaction (the same as generated by Bitcoin, not only sandbox version),
the testing that we were doing was also based on Bitcoin. The testing procedure was done such way:
we provided the same information to the our wallet that was used to generate the real transaction and checked the result.\\
The identity of the generated transaction will prove the correctness (on protocol basis) of creation fucntion. \\
For better testing we used the transactions that were verified by miners (means that it was verified and the correctness was proved).
All transactions that we were using were generated the same way as it was generated by Bitcoin wallet. \\
According to the code that we were using and thanks for the type inference and the systems that we were used our code is proved to 
be pure functional (it means that there is no possible change of state).
